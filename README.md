These files contain both Matlab and Python code for estimation of volatility models.
GARCH and GJR-GARCH model estimation are avaliable only in Python.
Basic stochastic volatilty model is avaliable for both Matlab and Python. Note that there are differences. For Python, this code is for estimation the model which the state variable follows a pure random walk process. For Matlab, both JPR and KSC algorithm are avaliable for state variable follows a stationary AR(1) process.
In my point of view, stationary process is mainly used in finance application. Random walk is mainly used in macroeconomics.
I am sorry that I am new in Python thus the python code is really slow. Any useful suggestions are welcome.
